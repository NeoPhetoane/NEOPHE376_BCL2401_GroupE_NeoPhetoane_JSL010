# [JSL10] Submission: Escaping Vanilla JS: Abstraction Challenge

**Overview**
This application is a page that finds the most recently published book in a library, finds the intersection between two sets of data and then finally navigates through a labyrinth of the similar concept, which is async. The task was to debug the code and find DOM manipulation, method, logic and function errors.

**Reflections**

**Areas of Mastery**
Debugging: Even though the bugs were explained and how to fix them was stated, I still gained experience in identifying what kind of bugs I could face in the future and improved my ability to use best practice by being able to spot what exactly is wrong and how it should be in the first place.

Methods: This gave insight into the different methods like filter and has. Where filter checks through elements in an array and .has checks if whatever element it is instructed to check , is present.

Asynchronous programming: I was able to delve even deeper into how async functions work regarding the keywords "async", "await", "try" and "catch". The former declares that the function will have to honor some promises, "await" literally awaits other promises to fulfil before the one after it, while "try" checks the function for errors and "catch" exposes it.

**Challenges Faced**

Asynchronous Programming: As much as, I am somewhat comfortable with the concept of Async programming, I struggled with it a lot. I really had to understand why there was an “await” and the importance of locating errors and most importantly, the form of writing.

Syntax: Not necessarily for this project alone, but it highlighted that I struggle with knowing the form and exact order brackets and keywords go in. I have to reference the order of writing even when I understand the logic.

**Areas for Improvement**

Adding more options for books: There could be a function that chooses a book at random, instead of just the latest because the outcome will be the same each time.

Interactivity: Having the user able to input some information instead of just pressing three buttons.

**Overall Learning Experience**

This project was very insightful, it helped me delve deeper and have more practice on asynchronous programming and DOM manipulation. I learnt to use keywords, where to use them in the function and calls and how to fetch elements correctly. It was a debugging project, therefore, very little coding was done but it forced me to look at the code and also understand it in order to know what was incorrect and how to correct it.
